# blaxel-shell

Interactive shell over repos in a [Mesa](https://mesa.dev) org running inside a [Blaxel](https://blaxel.ai) sandbox.

Spins up a Blaxel sandbox, installs the Mesa CLI via the install script, mounts your org's repos via FUSE, and drops you into a minimal shell.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install

# Create a .env in this directory (gitignored)
cp .env.example .env

# Now populate your .env file with the required values

# Run
npm start
```

```

Connected to your-org. Type "exit" or Ctrl+C to quit.

$ ls
repo-one  repo-two  repo-three
$ exit
Cleaning up sandbox...
Bye!
```

## How it works

1. Creates a Blaxel sandbox (Alpine-based, runs as root)
2. Installs system dependencies and the Mesa CLI via the install script (`mesa.dev/install.sh`), which detects Alpine and adds the correct APK repository
   - Uses `gcompat` instead of `libc6-compat` to avoid gRPC deadlocks
3. Mints a short-lived access token from your private key outside the sandbox and starts the Mesa FUSE daemon with it. Your private key never enters the sandbox.
4. Drops you into a minimal REPL at the mount path
